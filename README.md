## Overview
This repository provides various feature packages for use in MapleStory Worlds (MSW).

Each project folder includes a .mod file along with the mlua source files used in the package.
You can download any package you need and import it into your MSW project.

See the README file in each package for detailed usage information.

## Mod File Import Instructions

### What is a Mod File?
A mod file contains a copy of a full project that can be imported into a MapleStory Worlds project. When importing a .mod file, it will import the entire project at the state that it was when it was created, but will overwrite all the files of your current project. 

### Create a new Project
Create a new project in MapleStory Worlds through "Create" > "Create New" using any template  (The project will be overwritten by the project files.)

### Download the .mod File
Click download on your desired project in the download section to download the mod file associated with the project.

### Import the .mod File to Maker Project
Import the .mod file by navigating to File > Import from File to import the project file and overwrite the current project with the project downloaded in the previous step.

### Follow the readme instructions 
Reference the project page found in the associated github project folder for project specific instructions or additional info (Link to project page also found in the download section).
 
## ModPackage File Import Instructions

### What is a ModPackage File?
A mod package file, as the name suggests, is a package of certain scripts, assets, models, etc from a certain MapleStory Worlds Project. A mod package does not share the entire project, but rather allows the sharing of parts of your project with other creators, or with your other projects. 

### Download the .modpackage file 
Download the modpackage file from the download section of the github repository. 
![Import Mod](https://github.com/MapleStory-Worlds-Global/GithubAssets/blob/7fe64477e9e49f86623a5bba007bc62bf78e0d31/HowToImportModPackage/HowTo_1.png "Download Package")

### Import the .modpackage file 
Import the .modpackage file into the project you wish to import. 

### Select Assets for import 
Select which assets from the package that you wish to import. 
As a rule of thumb, if you're importing a package from MapleStory-Worlds-Global repositories, the assets in the "Core" folder will be the critical main logic behind the project, and the "Sample" is an optional implementation of the assets in the "Core" folder.
